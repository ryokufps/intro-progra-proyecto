## Project Title
**Inventory Management System**

## Objective
Develop an inventory management system that allows users to register, consult, modify, and delete products in a warehouse. The system should use arrays as a means of storage and should be developed in two stages:

## Deliverables

### [Stage 1 - RAPTOR Avalonia (2 weeks)](https://github.com/ryokufps/intro-progra-proyecto/tree/main/raptor)
- Design and implement the inventory management system using the RAPTOR Avalonia programming language.
- **Functionalities:**
  - **Product Registration:** Allows entering the basic information of a product, such as name, description, price, and stock quantity.
  - **Product Consultation:** Allows searching for products by name, description, or product code.
  - **Product Modification:** Allows modifying the information of an existing product.
  - **Product Deletion:** Allows deleting a product from the system.
- The system must use arrays to store product information.

### Stage 2 - Python (4 weeks)
- Rewrite the inventory management system in the Python programming language (console).
- The system should retain the same functionalities developed in Stage 1.
- The system should use arrays as a means of storing product information.
- The system should present a console-based user interface that allows the user to interact with the system.

## Resources
- RAPTOR Avalonia programming language
